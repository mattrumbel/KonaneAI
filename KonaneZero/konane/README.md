Priority:
- Starting sequence needs to be correct.
- Make sure players are actually switching
- Do we need getSymmetries, getCanonicalForm (see Tafl)?

TODO (any order):
- Reasoning behind inverting board is sound, current player always play as 1?
- Starting sequence needs to be correct
- Arena, coach, pit need to be better understood
